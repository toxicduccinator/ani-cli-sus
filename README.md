# ani-cli-sus

a sussy cli to browse and watch anime. sus fork of a fork of pystardust's ani-cli

works the same as the normal ani-cli but its among us themed, tho some commands might be changed, for example instead of 'worst' quality its now 'sus'

usually fixed faster than normal ani-cli, also allows me to add random shit to it

## installation
the same as normal ani-cli, just a different link and name

cloning the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/toxicduccinator/ani-cli-sus.git
```
cding into it
```bash
cd ani-cli-sus
```
installing
```bash
sudo make
```

if it fails on installing see if you have a /usr/local/bin directory, if not create it

*btw if you are retarded you can manually put the ani-cli-sus into /usr/local/bin (if you dont have this directory then create it, because installing this in other binary folders can lead to automatic magic uninstallation, and is just in general bad practice)*
